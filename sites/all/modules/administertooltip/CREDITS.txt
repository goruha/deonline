The Administertooltip module has its roots in madcap's own theme "Madtheme". It started with
a simple link on a block and from there it grew to be a standard functionality
within that theme. At some point there was an idea that this functionality could
also be in a seperate module where hooks could add more links on the administertooltips.
After a little proof of concept Kevin Franke and Jaap Broeders started to professionalize the module
and create an internal alpha version to be tested.
