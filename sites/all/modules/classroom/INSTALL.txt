INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Place the classroom folder into your modules directory.

  2. Go to 'Administer -> Site building -> Modules' and enable the 'Classroom
  module'. You can also enable any other classroom related module.

  3. Go to 'Administer -> Site configuration -> Classroom' to do some basic
  configuration. You must select at least one content type for each key concept
  (course, assignment, response and resource). Any simple content type will
  work.

  4. Set up permissions. Setting up permissions by hand can be a bit bothering.
  So in the modules' settings page you have a 'Roles and permission' tab where
  you can instruct classroom module to set up basic permissions automatically.
  Read 'ROLES AND PERMISSIONS' section for more info.

  5. Recommended: enable the 'Courses' link (it's located in the 'Navigation'
  menu).

  6. Optional: enable the 'Classroom: my courses' block.


ROLES AND PERMISSIONS
---------------------

Although it isn't mandatory, it is a good idea to set up different roles for
students and teachers, so permissions management could be easier.

Classroom module is able to set up basic permissions by itself for teachers and students:

  * For teachers:
    - classroom access
    - create assignment content
    - edit own assignment content
    - delete own assignment content
    - edit any assignment content
    - delete any assignment content
    Note: you can revoke 'edit/delete any assignment content'. In that
    case, teachers could only edit/delete their own assignments.

  * For students:
    - classroom access
    - create response content
    - edit own response content
    - delete own response content

Some additional permissions are not added automatically to any role. You
must assign them as you wish:

  * For classroom administrator:
    - classroom administer

  * For course managers (people who can create courses):
    - create course content
    - edit own course content
