TEACHERS AND MANAGERS
---------------------

At this time, a special class of user exists: the manager. Course managers can
manager teachers and students. But, if they're only managers, they can't
perform teachers' tasks (as creating assignments).

Anyway, a user could be manager and teacher for the same course. Indeed, when a
user creates a course, she becomes automatically in manager and teacher of that
course.
