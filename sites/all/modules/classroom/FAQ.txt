Frequently Asked Questions

This is a minimal FAQ which is taken from support request http://drupal.org/node/730780.
Thanks to drm and Nick Fedchik for their questions.

1. How to setup permissions

Classroom can setup permissions for you. After selecting which node types will
be used as 'Courses', 'Assignments', 'Resources' and 'Responses', go to 'Roles
and permissions', select roles and click 'Adjust permissions'.

Anyway, you can read more about permissions in INSTALL.txt.

2. How to setup assignments?

You can have different types of assignments. For example, a plain Drupal node
could be an assignment: you can use that node to present the assignment (using
the body or an attachment). The students could complete that assignment and you
can grade the response.

But if you use classroom_quiz, you could use a quiz (from Quiz module) as
assignment. In that case, the response's grade will be calculated automatically
(although you can change it).

3. How to setup blocks visibility for each role?

You have three blocks: 'My courses', 'My assignments' and 'Topics'. If a user
is subscribed to any course, the 'My courses' block won't be displayed. The
same applies to 'My assignments' block.

The 'Topics' block it's only shown when you're into the 'classroom'.

4. Can I grade students using polls?

No, you can't. But you can use a quiz if you enable the classroom_quiz module
(provided with Classroom). Anyway, it's posible to writ a module to extend
Classroom so you can use polls as assignments.

5. How do students apply for a course?

If you use classroom_signup module (bundled with Classroom), students could visit
the Classroom main page (http://www.example.com/?q=classroom and apply for
a course clicking on the 'Sign up' link.

The course's manager could then accept or deny this sign up request.

And that's all! I hope it helps.

Thank you for trying Classroom!
